# TryneX - Quick Netlify Setup

## Easy 5-Step Setup:

### 1. Deploy Your Site
- Go to **netlify.com** → Sign up → "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
- **Drag the entire project folder** to Netlify
- Wait for deployment ✅

### 2. Enable Identity & Admin Access
- In Netlify dashboard: **Site settings** → **Identity** → **Enable Identity**
- Set "Registration" to **Invite only**
- Enable **Git Gateway** (under Services)

### 3. Create Admin Account
- **Identity** → **Invite users** → Enter your email
- Check email → Set password

### 4. Access Admin Panel
- Go to **yoursite.netlify.app/admin**
- Login with your credentials
- Start managing content! 🎉

### 5. Test Everything
- Add a test product in CMS
- Check if it appears on your website
- Update contact information

## Troubleshooting:
❌ **Can't access /admin?** → Check if Identity is enabled
❌ **Login fails?** → Ensure Git Gateway is enabled
❌ **Changes don't save?** → Use "Publish" not "Save as draft"

## Your Site Features:
✅ Product management via CMS
✅ WhatsApp ordering system
